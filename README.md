REX

REX is a new project of CSS framework. Our goal is to make easier flexbox firstly, and also have some responsive grid/font. In the future, we want to made a Javascript framework, that will be a friend of Rex. =) Actually, we just use SASS to make Rex stronger, but why not take a look at less, compass...
